## Users Extraction [TASK 4] :

1) `admin` is the default username.

2) `admin` is the default password.

3) login with admin creds to get the `cookie`.

4) if we played with the userid parametre, we get some users, the correct one is bryce.

`http://10.10.201.204/users/sample.php?userid=11`

5) the password for bryce is the `username`.7


## XSS [TASK 5] :

We successfully managed to trigger XSS in the search bar & in the Guestbook with this basic script :

```<script>alert('hello bvr0n')</script>```


## Injection [TASK 6] :

2) We can inject `SQLI` in the login form with this : 

`' or 1=1--`


## Misc & Logic Flaws [TASK 7]:

1) The parameter is the `userid=` we found erlier.

2) Upload a file named `../etc/passwd` and we get the file traversal.

3) When trying to purchase a picture we get a `High Quality Link`, that's the restricted side.

4) Apply this coupon multiple time till you get it for free `SUPERYOU21`
